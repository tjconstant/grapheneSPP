\usage{
phonon_coupling(q, omega, d = 3.5e-10, omega_TO, omega_LO,
  eps_graphene = 3.9, eps_substrate = 2.4)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{wavevector [m^-1]}

\item{omega}{angular frequency [s^-1]}

\item{d}{distance between graphene and substrate [m]}

\item{omega_TO}{vector of frequencies of transverse optical phonons [cm^-1]}

\item{omega_LO}{vector of frequencies of longitudinal optical phonons [cm^-1]}

\item{eps_graphene}{static permittivity}

\item{eps_substate}{permittivity at infinity / high frequency dielectric constant (also refered to elsewhere as eps_inf)}
}
\description{
Function to return surface phonon frequencies and coupling coupling coefficents for dispersion
